- Topic: nb-NO default, per-user language, emojis allowed, light humor
- Decisions so far: NB-first language; per-user tone; plan in a single file
- Questions for team: 1) confirm per-user tone table schema, 2) confirm /tone-set command plan
- Research notes: plan aligns with memory/calendar features; ensure tests cover tone paths
